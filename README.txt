#### dependencies:

- opening:
  As for this is a really complex program, which uses a lot of modules, there are required dependencies needed
  in order to run the program. keep in mined the program was writen in python 3.8.6, so any python version lower
  than 3.6.1 might not work properly. Moreover, built-in python modules are being used, so keep that in mind.

- the modules are:
  - opencv-python==4.5.3.56

- to install manually the required none-built-in python modules in command line:
  write in the project command line:
- install the dependencies manually by writing the following list to the command line in the project directory:
````
pip install opencv-python==4.5.3.56
````
- install app dependencies by writing the "-r" option to install the requirements
  writen in a file, and write the following line in the project directory:
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
